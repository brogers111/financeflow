 IN CASE OF ERRORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS:
Call us at 1-866-564-2262 or write us at the address on the front of this statement immediately if you think your statement or receipt is incorrect or if
you need more information about a transfer listed on the statement or receipt.
For personal accounts only: We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we sent you the FIRST statement on which the problem or error
appeared. Be prepared to give us the following information:
 • Your name and account number;
• A description of the error or the transaction you are unsure about, and why you think it is an error or want more information; and
• The amount of the suspected error.
We will investigate your complaint and will correct any error promptly. If we take more than 10 business days (or 20 business days for new
accounts) to do this, we will provide provisional credit to your account for the amount you think is in error so that you will have use of the money
during the time it takes us to complete our investigation.
For business accounts, our practice is to follow the procedures described above as detailed in your Deposit Account Agreement or other
applicable agreements, but we are not legally required to do so. For example, we require you to notify us no later than 30 days after we sent you
the first statement on which the error appeared. We may require you to provide us with a written statement that the disputed transaction was
unauthorized. We are also not required to give provisional credit.
IN CASE OF ERRORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT NON-ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFERS : Contact us immediately if your statement is
incorrect or if you need more information about any non-electronic funds transfers on this statement. For more details, see your Deposit Account
Agreement or other applicable agreements that govern your account.

 Overdraft   and   Overdraft   Fee   Information   for   Your   Chase   Checking   Account
 What   You   Need   to   Know   About   Overdrafts   and   Overdraft   Fees
 An   overdraft   occurs   when   you   do   not   have   enough   money   in   your   account   to   cover   a   transaction,   but   we   pay   it   anyway.
Whether   your   account   has   enough   money   to   cover   a   transaction   is   determined   during   our   nightly   processing.   During   our
nightly   processing,   we   take   your   previous   end   of   days   balance   and   post   credits.   If   there   are   any   deposits   not   yet   available
for   use   or   holds   (such   as   a   garnishment),   these   will   reduce   the   account   balance   used   to   pay   your   transactions.   Then   we
subtract   any   debit   transactions   presented   during   our   nightly   processing.   The   available   balance   shown   to   you   during   the   day
may   not   be   the   same   amount   used   to   pay   your   transactions   as   some   transactions   may   not   be   displayed   to   you   before   nightly
processing.

We   pay   overdrafts   at   our   discretion,   which   means   we   do   not   guarantee   that   we   will   always   authorize   or   pay   any   transactions
presented   for   payment.   If   we   do   not   authorize   an   overdraft,   your   transaction   will   be   declined.   If   we   do   not   pay   an   overdraft,
your   transaction   will   be   returned.   Additional   information   about   overdrafts   and   your   account   features   can   be   found   in
the    Deposit   Account   Agreement .
We   can   cover   your   overdrafts   in   three   different   ways:
1.   We   have   a   Standard   Overdraft   Practice   that   comes   with   your   account.
 2.   We   offer   Overdraft   Protection   through   a   link   to   a   Chase   savings   account,   which   may   be   less   expensive   than   our
Standard   Overdraft   Practice.   You   can   contact   us   to   learn   more.
SM
3.   We   also   offer   Chase   Debit   Card   Coverage   ,   which   allows   you   to   choose   how   we   treat   your   everyday   debit   card
transactions   (e.g.   groceries,   gasoline   or   dining   out),   in   addition   to   our   Standard   Overdraft   Practice.
This   notice   explains   our   Standard   Overdraft   Practice   and   Chase   Debit   Card   Coverage.
 • What   is   the   Standard   Overdraft   Practice   that   comes   with   my   account?
We   do authorize   and   pay   overdrafts   for   the   following   types   of   transactions:
• Checks   and   other   transactions   made   using   your   checking   account   number
• Recurring   debit   card   transactions   (e.g.   movie   subscriptions   or   gym   memberships)
• What   is   Chase   Debit   Card   Coverage?  
If   you   enroll   in   Chase   Debit   Card   Coverage   we   may   authorize   and   pay   overdrafts   for everyday   debit   card
transactions (e.g.   groceries,   gasoline   or   dining   out)   in   addition   to   our   Standard   Overdraft   Practice.
• What   fees   will   I   be   charged   if   Chase   pays   my   overdraft?
If   we   authorize   and   pay   an   overdraft,   well   charge   you   a   $34   Overdraft   Fee   per   transaction   during   our   nightly
processing   beginning   with   the   first   transaction   that   overdraws   your   account   balance   by   more   than   $50   (maximum   of
3   fees   per   business   day,   up   to   $102).
We   wont   charge   you   an   Overdraft   Fee   in   the   following   circumstances:
SM
• With   Chase   Overdraft   Assist   ,   we   wont   charge   an   Overdraft   Fee   if   youre   overdrawn   by   $50   or   less   at   the   end
of   the   business   day   OR if   youre   overdrawn   by   more   than   $50   and   you   bring   your   account   balance   to   overdrawn
by   $50   or   less   at   the   end   of   the   next   business   day   (you   have   until   11   p.m   ET   (8   p.m   PT)   to   make   a   deposit   or
transfer).   Chase   Overdraft   Assist   does   not   require   enrollment   and   comes   with   eligible   Chase   checking
accounts.
• We   wont   charge   an   Overdraft   Fee   for   transactions   that   are   $5   or   less.
• We   wont   charge   an   Overdraft   Fee   if   your   debit   card   transaction   was   authorized   when   there   was   a   sufficient
available   balance   in   your   account.
SM   SM
• For   Chase   Sapphire   Checking   and   Chase   Private   Client   Checking   accounts,   there   are   no   Overdraft   Fees
when   item(s)   are   presented   against   an   account   with   insufficient   funds   on   the   first   four   business   days   during   the
current   and   prior   12   statement   periods.   On   a   business   day   when   we   returned   item(s),   this   counts   toward   the
four   business   days   when   an   Overdraft   Fee   will   not   be   charged.
• What   if   I   want   Chase   to   authorize   and   pay   overdrafts   on   my   everyday   debit   card   transactions?
If   you   or   a   joint   account   owner   want   Chase   to   authorize   overdrafts   on   your   everyday   debit   card   transactions,   please
make   your   Chase   Debit   Card   Coverage   selection.   You   can   change   your   Chase   Debit   Card   Coverage   selection   at
®
any   time   by   signing   in   to   chase.com   or   Chase   Mobile   to   update   your   account   settings,   calling   us   at   1-800-935-9935
(or   at   1-713-262-1679   if   outside   the   U.S.),   or   visiting   a   Chase   branch.   We   accept   operator   relay   calls.
